## Another Todo/list App
* I'm using Webpack for loading all my components and bundling everything together
* Trying out postcss - plugin-based css based on C rather than SASS's ruby foundation

### Get Started
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, take the following steps to get up and running:

```bash
# From within the root folder, run npm install to get all dependencies
npm install

# Then:
npm run dev

```

### Things left to do:

* Build out menu
* Set up user authentication

For next week, I plan on building a landing page for this app
